CURRENT TODO (mean squared) ERROR MEASUREMENT 
impl located in: xgboost_basic_model


complexities of models (from highest to lowest):
1. goldonly
2. basic
3. intermediate
4. advanced
5. standard (from website)

Accuracy of these SHOULD increase by some factor (obviously, see graphs)
MSE could(?) be plugged into some Probability equation to measure:
- Probability of model making an errant prediction outcome / "false alarm" given
  certain model type / accuracy
- probability of model accuracy increasing/changing when a variable is added
- Accuracy% of model given how many variables
